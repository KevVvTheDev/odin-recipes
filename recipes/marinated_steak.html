    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. </p>
